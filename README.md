You've stumbled accross the Hack Club @ nest+m, a Middle School chapter of the international non-profit organization Hack Club! Whether you've never written a single piece of code or even if you're a coding master, this is the club for you. We meet every Friday from 2-3PM ET to work on different projects, ask questions, learn more about coding, and to hangout and make new friends! Our project topics range from making your own website to working with Arduinos and can be as advanced as you want it to be. Anyone from grade 6-8 is welcome.

Thanks to our supporters, Hack Club, Stickermule, Github, Notion, Repl, and Figma.

Special thanks to Sam Poder and Khushraj Rathod for helping me make the site!
